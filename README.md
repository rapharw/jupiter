## Motivation

To help squads improve resource management in cloud environments AND more.



## Technologies

- nodejs
- typescript
- docker

## How to use

After clone the repository, enter on your `jupiter` root path and follow the steps:

`BUILD`

```
docker build -t jupiter . 
```

![jupiter-docker-build.png](./img/jupiter-docker-build.png)


After build the docker image, execute the follow command:

`RUN`

```
docker run -it jupiter
```

**If you want to improve `jupiter` and test them, you will need to follow the `build` and `run` steps again. Otherwise just `run` it.**

#### LOCAL EXECUTION

**In case you want to develop more fast, you need to:**

- install in your machine the target wizard (e.g `az-cli`)
- execute `npm install`
- execute `npm run ts-node`



## How it works

### Dockerfile

The image is based on `centos` with `nodejs` installed. The image pack the `az cli` inside of it and provides a unique image.


### Jupiter

When jupiter is startup, a list of wizard options will be showed.

![jupiter-wizard-startup](./img/jupiter-wizard-startup.png)


To do this, you need to create the `your_file_with_-wizard-index.ts` file following the below nomenclature:


> `app > wizards > az-cli > az-cli-wizard-index.ts`



### Operations of a Wizard

When a wizard (e.g `az-cli`) is executed, a list of operations will be showed.


![jupiter-wizard-operation-list](./img/jupiter-wizard-operation-list.png)


To do this, you need to create the `your_file_with_-operation-index.ts` file following the below nomenclature:


> `app > wizards > az-cli > operations > az-login > az-cli-operation-index.ts`



### Operation Execution

By convention, create the `your_operation_execution_-command.ts` file following the below nomenclature:

> `app > wizards > az-cli > operations > az-login > az-login-command.ts`


In this example, the file will be execute de `az cli` *login* operation.



## Next steps

- [x] Improve readme
- [x] Improve docker build/run
- [ ] Use `alpine` image instead `centos/nodejs-10-centos7`
- [ ] Menu repeatable
- [ ] Refactoring operations executions
- [ ] Refactoring clean code
- [ ] Multi language
